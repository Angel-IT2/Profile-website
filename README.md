# Profile-website
I built my personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The design is fully responsive and follows a clean, professional layout with smooth animations and interactive features.
It showcases my skills, projects, and contact information, and reflects my passion for front-end development and user-friendly design.
I used Font Awesome for icons, Flexbox for layout, and custom JavaScript for smooth scrolling and navigation
